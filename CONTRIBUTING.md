# Contributing to the Sandboxie project

### Note: This is a community fork that took place after the release of the Sandboxie source code and not the official continuation of the previous development (see the [project history](./README.md#-project-history) and [#2926](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2926)).

## Monetary contributions

1. Get a [supporter certificate](https://sandboxie-plus.com/go.php?to=sbie-get-cert) <br>
A supporter certificate is like a license key and enables the use of new supporter exclusive features, like [Privacy Mode](https://sandboxie-plus.com/privacy-mode/) or [Application Compartment](https://sandboxie-plus.com/compartment-mode/) sandboxes. See the [Feature Comparison](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie-docs/blob/main/docs/Content/FeatureComparison.md) for more details and certificate options. <br>

2. Get a [Patreon subscription](https://www.patreon.com/DavidXanatos) <br>
Patreon certificates are valid for as long as the subscription is active and unlock all features. Patreons who have ended their subscription are entitled to a residual certificate corresponding to the total amount of their support. See also [how to renew a Patreon supporter certificate](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2144).

3. Donate with [PayPal](https://sandboxie-plus.com/go.php?to=donate)

4. Donate with cryptocurrencies <br>
In order to arrange custom payments with cryptocurrencies, please get in touch by [email](https://xanasoft.com/contact/).

**In case of licensing issues, please get in touch by [email](https://xanasoft.com/contact/) with the full name and order ID.**

## Non-monetary contributions

Contributor certificates do not expire (regardless of how many PCs you own) and are available to all people who open meaningful [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) or provide continued support to the [Sandboxie-docs](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie-docs) / [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) repositories.

To be eligible for a **contributor certificate**, a **non-trivial** contribution is required, as outlined below. Minor contributions (such as small typo fixes, minor UI tweaks, or small translation improvements) are appreciated and will be rewarded with a free [**developer certificate**](https://xanasoft.com/product/sandboxie-plus-developer/), which includes a home-use license valid for 1 year, but they do not qualify for a contributor certificate on their own.

Examples of **non-trivial contributions** that qualify for a **contributor certificate** include:

1. Adding a new Sandboxie Plus translation for the language of your country, see also [Localization notes and tips](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/discussions/1123#discussioncomment-1203489).
2. Updating an outdated translation where a significant portion of the content must be revised.
3. Helping to keep our [Sandboxie-docs repository](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie-docs) updated by providing a number of meaningful changes. More volunteers are needed to keep it constantly updated with the new introduced settings mentioned in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.
4. Providing new code that fix a specific Sandboxie issue or introducing a new functionality.
5. Become a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-personal-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-personal-account-repository#collaborator-access-for-a-repository-owned-by-a-personal-account) in the [Sandboxie-docs](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie-docs) / [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) repositories, by offering your availability (proving your continued support with open issues and/or sufficient skills to manage pull requests).

If you are willing to become a new contributor or collaborator, please get in touch by [email](https://xanasoft.com/contact/) for further details.
