# Sandboxie

Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32- and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.
