Application %2 is requesting Administrator privileges in sandbox:

You can allow this request (YES), in which case a UAC prompt may 
appear depending on your system settings. You can deny Administrator 
privileges but make the application believe it has them (NO), or you can 
abort the startup (CANCEL).

Note:  The program will continue to run under the supervision of Sandboxie even if Administrator 
privileges are granted. However, granting real Administrator rights may increase the risk of the 
application exploiting an unpatched Windows vulnerability or a vulnerable driver to escape the 
sandbox. Therefore, it is generally safer to grant only fake Administrator rights, 
although this may cause some installers to fail.
