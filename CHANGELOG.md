### Changed
- refactored **DNS Filter logic** to enable filtering even when no DNS resolution occurs or when no valid IP address is returned [#4811](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/4811) (thanks wzxjohn)

- added "EditAdminOnly=y" can now be configured per box
- added UI for CoverBoxedWindows in NewBoxWizard
- added UI option to start unsandboxed process but force child processes in SelectBoxWindow
- added option "AlertBeforeStart"
  - when it is set, a prompt pops up before launching a new program into the sandbox using "Start.exe" and checks if the program that started "Start.exe" is a Sandboxie component itself, if it is not, a warning pops up

### Added
- added option to limit the memory of sandboxed processes and the number of processes in a single sandbox through job object (thanks Yeyixiao)
  - use "TotalMemoryLimit" (number, in bytes) to set the overall memory limit for the sandbox, and "ProcessMemoryLimit" (number, in bytes) to limit memory for individual processes
  - use "ProcessNumberLimit" (number) to set process number limit
- added ability to adjust the logic speed of sandboxed processes, including reduced fixed latency and modified single-player speed (thanks Yeyixiao)
  - Note: you can set "UseChangeSpeed=y" to configure the following options: "AddTickSpeed", "AddSleepSpeed", "AddTimerSpeed", "LowTickSpeed", "LowSleepSpeed" and "LowTimerSpeed" (integer values only)
  - Note: these options use multiples instead of adding or subtracting; the "Add" series is configured by multiplication, while the "Low" series by division
  - Note: when set to "AddSleepSpeed=0", all sleep function calls will be skipped. For example, you can bypass fixed delay code in hidden malware, reducing analysis time without affecting essential operations, which is useful for virus analysts
- added /fcp /force_children command line option to Start.exe; it allows to start a program unsandboxed but have all its children sandboxed
- added ability to force sandboxed processes to use a pre-defined SOCKS5 proxy

## [1.0.4 / 5.55.4] - 2021-12-20

### Added
- mechanism to hook Win32 system calls now also works for 32-bit applications running under WoW64
- added customization to Win32k hooking mechanism, as by default only GdiDdDDI* hooks are installed
  - you can force the installation of other hooks by specifying them with "EnableWin32Hook=..."
  - or disable the installation of the default hooks with "DisableWin32Hook=..."
  - please note that some Win32k hooks may cause BSoDs or undefined behaviour (!)
  - the most obviously problematic Win32k hooks are blacklisted, this can be bypassed with "IgnoreWin32HookBlacklist=y"
- added debug option "AdjustBoxedSystem=n" to disable the adjustment of service ACLs running with a system token
- added "NoUACProxy=y" option together with the accompanying template, in order to disable UAC proxy
  - Note: boxes configured in compartment mode activate this template by default
- added UI option to change default RpcMgmtSetComTimeout preset
- added Plus installer option to start the default browser under Sandboxie through a desktop shortcut
- added more entries to the Plus installer (current translations on [Languages.iss](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/blob/master/Installer/Languages.iss) file need to be updated)

### Changed
- "EnableWin32kHooks=y" is now enabled by default, as no issues were reported in 1.0.3
  - Note: currently only the GdiDdDDI* hooks are applied, required for Chromium HW acceleration
- cleaned up low-level hooking code
- "RunRpcssAsSystem=y" is now auto applied for sandboxes in Application Compartment mode when "RunServicesAsSystem=y" or "MsiInstallerExemptions=y" are present

### Fixed
- fixed RPC handling in case a requested open service is not running [#1443](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1443)

## [1.0.3 / 5.55.3] - 2021-12-12

### Added
- added mechanism to hook Win32k system calls on Windows 10 and later, this should resolve the issue with Chromium HW acceleration
  - Note: this mechanism does not, yet, work for 32-bit applications running under WoW64
  - to enable it, add "EnableWin32kHooks=y" to the global INI section, this feature is highly experimental (!)
  - the hooks will be automatically applied to Chromium GPU processes
  - to force Win32k hooks for all processes in a selected box, add "AlwaysUseWin32kHooks=program.exe,y" [#1261](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1261) [#1395](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1395)

## [1.0.0 / 5.55.0] - 2021-11-17

### Added
- added Privacy Enhanced mode, sandboxes with "UsePrivacyMode=y" will not allow read access to locations containing user data
  - all locations except generic Windows system paths will need to be opened explicitly for read and/or write access
  - using "NormalFilePath=...", "NormalKeyPath=...", "NormalIpcPath=..." allows to open locations to be readable and sandboxed
- added new Application Compartment mode of operation, it is enabled by adding "NoSecurityIsolation=y" to the sandbox config
  - in this mode, security is traded in for compatibility, it should not be used for untrusted applications
  - Note: in this mode, file and registry filtering are still in place, hence processes run without administrative privileges
  - it is reasonably safe, all filtering can be disabled with "NoSecurityFiltering=y"
- added experimental use of ObRegisterCallbacks to filter object creation and duplication
  - this filtering is independent from the regular SbieDrv's syscall-based filtering, hence it also applies to Application Compartments
  - with it enabled, an application running in a compartment will not be able to manipulate processes running outside the sandbox
  - Note: this feature improves the security of non-isolated Application Compartment sandboxes
  - to enable this feature, set "EnableObjectFiltering=y" in the global section and reload the driver
  - when globally activated, the filtering can be disabled for individual boxes with "DisableObjectFilter=y"
- added "DontOpenForBoxed=n", this option disables the discrimination of boxed processes for open file and open key directives
  - this behaviour does not really improve security anyway, but may be annoying, also Application Compartments always disable this
- added setting to entirely open access to the COM infrastructure

### Changed
- reworked the resource access path matching mechanism to optionally apply more specific rules over less specific ones
  - for example "OpenFilePath=C:\User\Me\AppData\Firefox takes precedence over "WriteFilePath=C:\User\Me\"
  - to enable this new behaviour, add "UseRuleSpecificity=y" to your Sandboxie.ini, this behaviour is always enabled in Privacy Enhanced mode
  - added "NormalFilePath=..." to restore default Sandboxie behaviour on a given path
  - added "OpenConfPath=...", which similarly to "OpenPipePath=..." is a "OpenKeyPath=..." variant which applies to executables located in the sandbox
- removed option to copy a box during creation, instead the box context menu offers a duplication option
- reworked the box creation dialog to offer new box types

### Fixed
- fixed SBIE1401 notification during Sandboxie Plus uninstall (by mpheath) [68fa37d](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/commit/68fa37d45be2be3565917d0de097709b7aa009e0)
- fixed memory leak in driver handling FLT_FILE_NAME_INFORMATION (by Therzok) [#1371](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1371)

### Changed
- "OpenClsid=..." is no longer restricted to CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER execution contexts only
  - this allows to run objects with the CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER flag in the COM helper service
- in the trace view, now multiple types can be selected at once
- a few Plus UI entries were made translatable (by gexgd0419) [#1320](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1320)

## [0.9.0 / 5.51.0] - 2021-07-29 (pre-release)

### Added
- added support for Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to be used instead of the device-based network blocking scheme
  - to enable this support, add 'NetworkEnableWFP=y' to the global section and reboot or reload the driver
  - to use WFP for a specific sandbox, add 'AllowNetworkAccess=n'
  - you can allow certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,y'
  - you can also enable this policy globally by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=n' to the global section
  - in this case you can exempt entire sandboxes by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=y' to specific boxes
  - you can block certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,n'
  - Note: WFP is less absolute than the old approach, using WFP will filter only TCP/UDP communication
  - restricted boxed processes will still be able to resolve domain names using the system service
  - however, they will not be able to send or receive data packets directly
  - the advantages of WFP is that filter rules can be implemented by restricting communication only to specified addresses or selected ports using "NetworkAccess=..."
- added fully functional rule-based packet filter in user mode for the case when "NetworkEnableWFP=y" is not set
  - the mechanism replaces the old "BlockPort=..." functionality
  - Note: this filter applies only to outgoing connections/traffic, for incoming traffic either the WFP mode or a third-party firewall is needed
  - like the old user mode based mechanism, malicious applications can bypass it by unhooking certain functions
  - hence it's recommended to use the kernel mode WFP-based mechanism when reliable isolation is required
- added new trace option "NetFwTrace=*" to trace the actions of the firewall components
  - please note that the driver only trace logs the kernel debug output, use DbgView.exe to log
- API_QUERY_PROCESS_INFO can now be used to get the impersonation token of a sandboxed thread
  - Note: this capability is used by TaskExplorer to allow inspecting sandbox-internal tokens
  - Note: a process must have administrative privileges to be able to use this API
- added a UI option to switch "MsiInstallerExemptions=y" on and off
  - just in case a future Windows build breaks something in the systemless mode
- added sample code for ObRegisterCallbacks to the driver
- added new debug options "DisableFileFilter=y" and "DisableKeyFilter=y" that allow to disable file and registry filtering
  - Note: these options are for testing only and disable core parts of the sandbox isolation
- added a few command line options to SandMan.exe

### Changed
- greatly improved the performance of the trace log, but it's no longer possible to log to both SandMan and SbieCtrl at the same time
- reworked process creation code to use PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx and improved process termination

### Fixed
- added missing hook for ConnectEx function

### Changed
- replaced the Process List used by the driver with a much faster Hash Map implementation
  - Note: this change provides an almost static system call speed of 1.2µs regardless of the running process count
  - the old list, with 100 programs running required 4.5µs; with 200: 12µs; and with 300: 18µs per syscall
  - Note: some of the slowdown was also affecting non-sandboxed applications due to how the driver handles certain callbacks

## [0.7.1 / 5.48.5] - 2021-02-21

### Added
- enhanced RpcMgmtSetComTimeout handling with "UseRpcMgmtSetComTimeout=some.dll,n"
  - this option allows to specify if RpcMgmtSetComTimeout should be used or not for each individual dll

### Changed
- reworked ApiLog, added PID and PID filter
- auto config reload on change is now delayed by 500ms to prevent reloading multiple times on incremental changes
- Sandbox names now replace "_" with " " thus enabling names that consist of separate words

## [0.2.2 / 5.41.2] - 2020-06-19

### Added
- added option "SeparateUserFolders=n" to no longer have the user profile files stored separately in the sandbox
- added "SandboxieLogon=y" - it makes processes run under the SID of the "Sandboxie" user instead of the Anonymous user
  - Note: the global option "AllowSandboxieLogon=y" must be enabled, the "Sandboxie" user account must be manually created first and the driver reloaded, else process start will fail
- improved debugging around process creation errors in the driver

### Fixed
- fixed log messages getting lost after driver reload
- fixed MSI installer issue, see Proc_CreateProcessInternalW_RS5

- the driver file is now obfuscated to avoid false positives
- additional debug option for Sandboxie.ini named OpenToken=y which combines UnrestrictedToken=y and UnfilteredToken=y
  - Note: using these options weakens the sandboxing, they are intended for debugging and may be used for better application virtualization later

### Changed
- SbieDll.dll when processing InjectDll now looks in the SbieHome folder for the DLLs if the entered path starts with a backslash
  - i.e. "InjectDll=\LogAPI\i386\logapi32v.dll" or "InjectDll64=\LogAPI\amd64\logapi64v.dll"
