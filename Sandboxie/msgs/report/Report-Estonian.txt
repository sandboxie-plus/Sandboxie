The classic Sandboxie UI (SbieCtrl.exe) has very limited
resource monitoring and event tracing capabilities.

For optimal troubleshooting it is highly advisable 
to install the new UI, Sandboxie-Plus (SandMan.exe),
which provides excellent tracing and monitoring capabilities.

Do you want to download Sandboxie-Plus now?
.

6002;txt;01
Visit <a ID="whats_new">sandboxie-plus.com</a> to learn about the new functionality of Sandboxie-Plus,
or directly click <a ID="upgrade">here</a> to download the latest Sandboxie-Plus installer.
.

6003;txt;01
The legacy UI of Sandboxie classic does not implement support for the network firewall functionality.

You can though configure the feature supported by the core components using the ini file, rules are structured like following:
NetworkAccess=iexplorer.exe,Allow; Port=80,443; Address=192.168.0.1-192.168.100.255; Protocol=TCP

If you prefer to use a UI to control these options, please upgrade to Sandboxie-Plus, which has full UI support for all new features.
.

6004;pop;err;01
The configuration %3 of box %2 requires a supporter certificate. Processes in this box will be terminated after 5 minutes. For prolonged use, please consider supporting this project.
.

6005;txt;01
Note: Without administrative privileges installers will fail to start in the sandbox. Sandboxie-Plus offers an option to make many installers succeed without those privileges. You can enable this option also in the classic build manually, by adding "FakeAdminRights=y" to the ini section for this box.
.

6006;txt;01
The legacy UI of Sandboxie classic implements only support for a couple of restriction options.

Additional options like "ClosePrintSpooler=y", "OpenClipboard=n", "BlockNetParam=n" and much more can be set in the ini section for this box.
The modern UI (SandMan.exe) also offers more customization options for Start/Run and Internet access restrictions.

If you would prefer to use a UI to control these options, please upgrade to Sandboxie-Plus, which has full UI support for all new features.
.

6007;txt;01
Sandboxie Plus offers enhanced privacy protection by switching the old behavior from a black-list mode, i.e., allowing read access to the entire drive, except blocked by Closed Path or Write Path, to a white-list mode where sandboxed programs are only allowed to read generic system locations and read access to most user data must be first explicitly granted.

The legacy UI of Sandboxie classic does not implement support for this mode of operation. Although it can be configured using the ini file, it is recommended to use the modern Sandboxie-Plus UI (SandMan.exe) if you want to use privacy enhanced boxes.
.

6008;pop;err;01
The configuration %3 of box %2 requires a supporter certificate and can not be used without it.
.

6009;pop;err;01
The configuration %3 of box %2 requires an advanced supporter certificate.

You have installed Sandboxie more than %2 days ago.

So, you think David and the contributors are doing a great job?

Why don't you show it by supporting the project and getting a Supporter Certificate?

Sandboxie without a valid supporter certificate will now pause for a few seconds, to give you time to contemplate the possibility of supporting the project.

Getting Started Tutorial - Sandboxie
.

7851;txt;01
Getting Started with Sandboxie
.

7852;txt;01
Welcome to Sandboxie!

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.

This tutorial briefly explains the basic principles of using Sandboxie.
.

7853;txt;01
Note:  This tutorial is designed for use with the default sandbox, DefaultBox.
.

7854;txt;01
How Sandboxie Works (Illustration)
.

7855;txt;01
Start your Internet Web browser under Sandboxie
.

7856;txt;01
Please find the shortcut on your desktop and double-click it to run your web browser in the default sandbox, DefaultBox.
.

7857;txt;01
Click here to hide this window and show the desktop
.

7858;txt;01
Your browser is now running inside the sandbox
.

7859;txt;01
Programs in the sandbox can modify only the contents of the sandbox.

When you save or download files, they go into the sandbox.  If you save a file to your Desktop, Documents or Downloads folders, Sandboxie offers to move the file out of the sandbox.

Try it now:  Download a file in your browser to your desktop folder (in the sandbox), and recover the file to your real desktop.
.

7860;txt;01
Delete the contents of your sandbox
.

7861;txt;01
You can think of the sandbox as a piece of transparent paper placed between the program and your computer.  Deleting the contents of the sandbox is like discarding a used piece of paper and replacing it with a clean one.
.

7862;txt;01
Try it now:  Delete the contents of your DefaultBox sandbox.  Please find the yellow Sandboxie icon in the highlighted corner of your screen, and click:
.

7863;txt;01
Right-click on the yellow Sandboxie icon,

then select DefaultBox, and invoke Delete Contents.
.

7864;txt;01
Ready to go!
.

7865;txt;01
Thank you for taking the time to go through this tutorial.  You can visit the Sandboxie web site for more tutorials and tips.

The default settings in Sandboxie provide full protection, but you may wish to review the sandbox configuration commands in the Sandbox menu in the Sandboxie Control program window.
.

7988;txt;01
Your Supporter Certificate is valid, Thank You :-)
.

7989;txt;01
The Supporter Certificate has expired :'(
.

7990;txt;01
Please copy the entire Supporter Certificate into the clipboard and press OK.
.

7991;txt;01
Failed to save certificate to file.
.

7992;txt;01
The certificate is not valid.
.

7993;txt;01
The certificate is valid and has been successfully applied.
.

8014;ins;02
If this step fails and your computer locks up or restarts, please restart your computer in Safe Mode, then run this installation program to remove Sandboxie.

8106;txt;02
The following programs must be closed before the installation can continue.
Click OK to close these programs and continue.  Click Cancel to abort the installation.
